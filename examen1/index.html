That's why the metro was created because it is like a car that can move a huge amount of people.
            <br>But you know, although the metro exists there's still a lot of people so they have to wait to get their turn and this make them to arrive late to school, to their jobs and even the movie theater.</br></h3>

            <br>This concept is applied in Barcelona and its useful because the lenght that they have to move to get to basic services is less, which makes more efficient their public transportation and also makes possible to find alternative solutions, like riding a bike or walking.</h3>

            <br>I believe that the job done, research about urban planning concepts, data analysis and other solutions applied will help me to find a sustainable solution. Being honest I'm proud of the effort I've been putting in this project, because is a problem that really motivates me. I know that I have more work to do because I'm working alone, but was a personal decision due to my absence during the partial and because I didn't wanted to affect my partner.</br>

                  <h2>Design thinking</h2>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">methodology</p>
                  <p>Design thinking utilizes elements from the designer's toolkit like empathy and experimentation to arrive at innovative solutions. By using design thinking, you make decisions based on what future customers really want instead of relying only on historical data or making risky bets based on instinct instead of evidence.
                  <br></br>
                  <br>“Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.” - Tim Brown</br></p>
                  <br>The methodology is iterative and follows five steps:</br>
                  <br>Empathize (to undestand the challenge). </br>
                  <br>Define (to articulate the problem you want to solve). </br>
                  <br>Ideate (to find potential solutions). </br>
                  <br>Prototype (to test your idea). </br>
                  <br>Test (to validate, correct and improve). </br>
